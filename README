# compose-wa
An prototype project for music exploration and composition.
Contains application code for the COE 332 Final project. (I will add docstrings soon enough.)
The element python file is the main file for now; to import routes, just do an `import element` and an `import musicpy` as necessary.
Examples are available in the compose-wa python file. I will add to these as I work on the project.

Note that this will go into the `\app\core` folder of the project.

The development directory plan will have

```
\app
\app\core\<all the chord analysis stuff in this repo>
\app\<add your routes in python files here...some examples are given in the `compose` repository (name subject to change!)
\doc\<markdown files for documentation>
Dockerfile
Makefile
README
....
```

I will explain the rest in the `compose` repo.
